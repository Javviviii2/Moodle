# Customize a Kubernetes resource
#   By default, Kubernetes resource names are automatically assigned
#   based on objects in the YAML manifests, e.g. Deployment name.
#
#   Tilt strives for sane defaults, so calling k8s_resource is
#   optional, and you only need to pass the arguments you want to
#   override.
#
#   More info: https://docs.tilt.dev/api.html#api.k8s_resource
#
# k8s_resource('my-deployment',
#              # map one or more local ports to ports on your Pod
#              port_forwards=['5000:8080'],
#              # change whether the resource is started by default
#              auto_init=False,
#              # control whether the resource automatically updates
#              trigger_mode=TRIGGER_MODE_MANUAL

# Run local commands
#   Local commands can be helpful for one-time tasks like installing
#   project prerequisites. They can also manage long-lived processes
#   for non-containerized services or dependencies.
#

#                cmd='which helm > /dev/null || brew install helm',
#                # `cmd_bat`, when present, is used instead of `cmd` on Windows.
#                cmd_bat=[

# Extensions are open-source, pre-packaged functions that extend Tilt
#
#   More info: https://github.com/tilt-dev/tilt-extensions

load('ext://git_resource', 'git_checkout')


# Organize logic into functions
#   Tiltfiles are written in Starlark, a Python-inspired language, so
#   you can use functions, conditionals, loops, and more.
#
#   More info: https://docs.tilt.dev/tiltfile_concepts.html
#


# Edit your Tiltfile without restarting Tilt
#   While running `tilt up`, Tilt watches the Tiltfile on disk and
#   automatically re-evaluates it on change.
#
#   To see it in action, try uncommenting the following line with
#   Tilt running.
# tilt_demo()
